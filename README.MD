# Github Repository Finder

## How to use

```bash
python findRepo.py
```
## Features

The GitHub Repository Finder uses the GitHub API to list the public repositories of any GitHub user.

## Development Notes
When starting this project, I knew I would need to utilize the GitHub API to retrieve user repository information. I was able to quickly find the necessary route on the GitHub API website. After testing the route using Postman, I started coding.
